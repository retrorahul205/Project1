Here is the required content for the fastapi backend and nextjs frontend the only problem is the requirements are not provided by the youtuber so you would have to sort that out 

TO START THE BACKEND 
just cd into the fastapi and install requirements using

pip install -r requirements.txt

after that cd to api and run

fastapi run main.py 
(if there is an error related to fastapi[standard] you would have to install that on your own.

AND TO RUN THE FRONTEND

just open new terminal (while backend is still running with no errors)

cd nextjs
npm install
npm run dev 

And you are good to go.
Sorry for the trouble.
Thank you.
